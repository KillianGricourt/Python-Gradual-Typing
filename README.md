This repository contains the work I have done about gradual typing for python.
The code I wrote is located in the file `/pyright/packages/pyright-internal/src/analyzer/checkerExtension.ts`
The file Pyright contains the Pyright project available at this git [repository](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright)

I don't know what license to use or anything, feel free to use my work as long as you mention me :)
